## Features

- **Node Launcher**  
  Loads wallet keys, allows port customization, updates Makefile, and launches leader & follower nodes in detached `screen` sessions.

## Hardware Requirements

> Hardware requirements are highly speculative since mainnet launch details are not finalized.

| RAM      | CPU              | Disk           |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| 64 GB    | 6 cores or higher | 100-200 GB SSD |

- More CPU cores = higher hashrate = better mining chances  
- These specs are for testnet; mainnet requirements may vary.

---

## Prerequisites

- Linux/macOS with:
  - `screen` installed
  - `make` and build tools
  - `bash`

---

## Usage

## Quick Start

```bash
sudo apt-get -qq update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y

### Run Nockchain Script
Clone the repository:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedialect/nockchain/node_launcher.sh  | sudo bash

```

- If this is your first run, it will build Nockchain in a detached `screen` session.
- Rerun after build completes to generate wallet keys.
